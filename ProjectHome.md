Pipp is a tool to help build static websites; it is used to produce this website. Pipp can reduce the manual effort needed to perform common tasks, such as:

  * Updating content across multiple pages
  * Multiple presentations of content (e.g. printable view)
  * Hierarchial navigation panes
  * Image width and height tags
  * Thumbnail images
  * Source code with syntax highlighting
  * Stylised text headings

A Pipp website is coded in .pip files, which are essentially HTML with some Pipp-specific tags. The tool processes this to produce the HTML website. Pipp works as an XSLT transformation - a stylesheet tuned for your website transforms your source code into HTML ready for publishing. Pipp provides a selection of XSLT helper functions that assist with common web development tasks.

Pipp can be controlled by a command line tool and a Windows system tray application.
